mission:
  ete: "1:50"
  distance: "293nm"
  description: |
    IFR night flight from Little Rock, AK (KLIT) to Oklahoma City (KOKC). Distance is 293 nm; 
    ETE is 1:50. Departure time is 2330Z. The purpose of this flight is to transport an important
    buisness person to a critical meetting the following day at 9:00AM. Any delays to the flight
    will be devastating for the meeting and will lead to extremely low customer approval. Low customer
    approval could also potentially bankrupt the struggling air carrier service. The alternates are 
    KMLC and KOKC.
