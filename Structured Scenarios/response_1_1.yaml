reasoning: |
  The flight is IFR at night from KLIT to KOKC. Current METARs and TAFs show that ceilings and 
  visibilities are IFR but above minimums at all points along the route. KOKC is forecasting 5SM visibility
  and ceilings gradually improving from 015 to SCT015 starting 1500Z, which is after our arrival,
  but during our arrival window (KLIT departure at 2330Z, 1:50 ETE means 0120Z arrival), conditions are
  expected to be OVC015, which is 1,500 feet and 5SMâ€”right at the IFR night minimums. There is
  no significant wind, turbulence, or icing forecasted, which is crucial given the Bonanza G36 lacks
  ice protection. Both the primary (KOKC) and alternate (KMLC) airports are expected to remain above
  alternate minimums throughout the time frame. Given the critical nature of the mission and marginal
  but legal conditions with no hazards, the flight can proceed under IFR.

decision: "go"

complaints: |
  The scenario does not specify the exact approach minimums for KOKC or KMLC, which are needed to
  confirm if the TAFs support legal alternate selection under 14 CFR 91.169. Also, the winds aloft
  data is not timestamped and lacks temperature/dewpoint spread, which would help assess potential
  for fog/BR formation. Some TAF data appears slightly malformed (e.g., "BKNO" instead of "BKN").
