reasoning: |
  The planned departure from FLY to LBL is at 1705 local, with sunset at 1806 and civil twilight ending at 1833. 
  The aircraft is VFR-only and the autopilot system, while FAA-certified, has not been tested at night in ten years. 
  Current weather at FLY shows broken ceilings at 2,900 ft and 4,600 ft AGL, with scattered clouds at 2,100 ft AGL. 
  While visibility is good and flight under VFR may be technically possible, the cloud layers present a risk of 
  inadvertent IMC, especially given the rapidly approaching sunset and lack of a full weather briefing. Additionally, 
  the suspected IMU drift introduces a significant reliability issue for the flight control system, which may 
  compromise situational awareness during marginal lighting or weather transitions. Without the ability to operate IFR, 
  this flight poses an undue risk to safety.

decision: "no go"

complaints: |
  - No official weather briefing is available or provided, reducing situational awareness and go/no-go confidence.
  - Suspected IMU drift in the autopilot system is a serious unresolved reliability concern.
  - The time of flight is close to sunset and extends into civil twilight, yet the autopilot has not been tested at night in a decade.
  - Cloud cover is near VFR minimums but not enough information is provided about en route ceiling or terrain clearance.
